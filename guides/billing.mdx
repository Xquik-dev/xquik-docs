Xquik uses a flat subscription model with a monthly usage quota. One monthly fee, no surprises.

## Subscription

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base plan** | $20/month |
| **Included monitors** | 1 |
| **Additional monitors** | $10/month each |
| **Payment** | Stripe (credit/debit card) |

Subscribe from the [dashboard](https://xquik.com). Your subscription activates immediately and renews monthly. An active subscription is required for all API access.

## Monthly Quota

Every subscription includes a monthly usage quota that resets each billing period. The quota covers operations that query the X API (searches, lookups, fetches). Management operations (monitors, webhooks, account) are unlimited.

When the quota is reached, metered API calls return `402 Payment Required`. Non-metered calls (list monitors, get account, manage webhooks) continue to work.

<Warning>
  The quota is a hard limit per billing period. There is no overage billing - metered calls are rejected once you hit the limit. Monitor your usage via the account endpoint to avoid interruptions.
</Warning>

## Monthly Operation Limits

Each subscription includes the following approximate operation limits per billing period:

| Operation | Monthly Limit |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tweet searches | ~66,000 |
| User lookups | ~55,000 |
| Follower fetches | ~66,000 |
| Verified follower fetches | ~33,000 |
| Follow checks | ~66,000 |

These limits are approximate and represent the maximum for a single operation type used exclusively. In practice, mixed usage across operation types shares the same quota pool.

## Usage Scenarios

Three realistic monthly estimates:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Light usage - $20/month">
   - 1 monitor (included)
   - ~100 tweet searches/day
   - Well within the monthly quota
   - **Total:** $20/month
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Moderate usage - $30/month">
   - 2 monitors ($20 base + $10 for the extra monitor)
   - ~500 tweet searches/day + ~200 user lookups/day
   - Comfortably within the monthly quota
   - **Total:** $30/month
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Heavy usage - $60/month">
   - 5 monitors ($20 base + $40 for 4 extra monitors)
   - ~2,000 tweet searches/day
   - Approaches the monthly quota limit
   - **Total:** $60/month
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Checking Usage

Call `GET /api/v1/account` to see your current period usage:

```bash
curl -s https://xquik.com/api/v1/account \
 -H "x-api-key: xq_YOUR_KEY_HERE" | jq
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "plan": "active",
  "monitorsAllowed": 1,
  "monitorsUsed": 1,
  "currentPeriod": {
    "start": "2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2026-03-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "usedMicrocents": "4500000",
    "capMicrocents": "10000000"
  }
}
```

Compare `usedMicrocents` against `capMicrocents` to calculate remaining capacity. Both values are internal unit strings -- compare them numerically.

<Tip>
  Poll the account endpoint periodically to track usage. Build alerts when `usedMicrocents` exceeds 80% of `capMicrocents` to avoid hitting the cap unexpectedly.
