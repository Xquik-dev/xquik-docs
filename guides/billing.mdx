# Billing & Usage

Xquik uses a simple subscription model with metered usage. One flat monthly fee, one usage cap, no surprises.

## Subscription

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base plan** | $20/month |
| **Included monitors** | 1 |
| **Additional monitors** | $10/month each |
| **Payment** | Stripe (credit/debit card) |

Subscribe from the [dashboard](https://xquik.com). Your subscription activates immediately and renews monthly. An active subscription is required for all API access.

## Usage Cap

Every subscriber gets a **$10/month usage cap** that resets each billing period. Usage is tracked in microcents:

| Unit | Value |
|------|-------|
| 1 microcent | $0.000001 |
| $10 cap | 10,000,000,000 microcents |

When the cap is reached, API calls that consume credits return `402 Payment Required`. Non-metered calls (list monitors, get account, manage webhooks) continue to work.

<Warning>
  The usage cap is a hard limit. There is no overage billing — calls are rejected once you hit $10. Monitor your usage via the account endpoint to avoid interruptions.
</Warning>

## Cost Per Operation

| Operation | Microcents | Dollar Cost | Operations per $10 Cap |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Tweet search | 150 | $0.00015 | ~66,666 |
| User lookup | 180 | $0.00018 | ~55,555 |
| Follower fetch | 150 | $0.00015 | ~66,666 |
| Verified follower fetch | 300 | $0.00030 | ~33,333 |
| Follow check | 150 | $0.00015 | ~66,666 |

Operations are metered automatically. Each API call that hits the X API deducts from your period balance.

## Usage Scenarios

Three realistic monthly estimates to help you plan:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Light usage — $20.45/month">
    - 1 monitor (included)
    - 100 tweet searches/day
    - **Base:** $20
    - **Usage:** 100 searches x 150 microcents x 30 days = 450,000 microcents = ~$0.45
    - **Total:** ~$20.45/month
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Moderate usage — $33.33/month">
    - 2 monitors ($20 base + $10 for the extra monitor)
    - 500 tweet searches/day + 200 user lookups/day
    - **Base:** $30
    - **Usage:** (500 x 150 + 200 x 180) x 30 = 3,330,000 microcents = ~$3.33
    - **Total:** ~$33.33/month
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Heavy usage — $69/month">
    - 5 monitors ($20 base + $40 for 4 extra monitors)
    - 2,000 tweet searches/day
    - **Base:** $60
    - **Usage:** 2,000 x 150 x 30 = 9,000,000 microcents = ~$9.00
    - **Total:** ~$69/month
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Checking Usage

Call `GET /api/v1/account` to see your current period usage:

```bash
curl -s https://xquik.com/api/v1/account \
  -H "x-api-key: xqk_YOUR_KEY_HERE" | jq
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "plan": "active",
  "monitorsAllowed": 1,
  "monitorsUsed": 1,
  "currentPeriod": {
    "start": "2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2026-03-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "capMicrocents": "10000000000",
    "usedMicrocents": "4500000"
  }
}
```

**Calculate remaining budget:**

```
Remaining microcents = capMicrocents - usedMicrocents
                     = 10,000,000,000 - 4,500,000
                     = 9,995,500,000 microcents

Remaining dollars    = 9,995,500,000 / 1,000,000,000
                     = ~$9.995

Remaining tweet searches = 9,995,500,000 / 150
                         = ~66,636 searches
```

<Tip>
  Poll the account endpoint periodically to track usage. Build alerts when `usedMicrocents` exceeds a threshold (e.g., 80% of `capMicrocents`) to avoid hitting the cap unexpectedly.
