Xquik uses a flat subscription model with a monthly usage quota. One monthly fee, no surprises.

## Subscription

| | |
|---|---|
| **Base plan** | $20/month |
| **Included monitors** | 1 |
| **Additional monitors** | $5/month each |
| **Payment** | Credit/debit card |

Subscribe from the [dashboard](https://xquik.com). Your subscription activates immediately and renews monthly. An active subscription is required for all API access.

## Monthly Quota

Every subscription includes a monthly usage quota that resets each billing period. All metered operations deduct from a single shared pool — there are no separate buckets per operation type.

When the quota is reached, metered API calls return `402 Payment Required`. Non-metered calls (monitors, webhooks, account, trends) continue to work normally.

<Warning>
  The quota is a hard limit per billing period. There is no overage billing — metered calls are rejected once you hit the limit. Monitor your usage via the account endpoint to avoid interruptions.
</Warning>

## Operation Limits

Each subscription includes the following approximate operation limits per billing period:

| Operation | Monthly limit |
|-----------|---------------|
| Tweet searches | ~66,000 |
| Tweet lookups | ~66,000 |
| User lookups | ~55,000 |
| Follower/following fetches | ~66,000 |
| Verified follower fetches | ~33,000 |
| Follow checks | ~66,000 |
| Article extractions | ~10,000 |

These are maximums for a single operation type used exclusively. Mixed usage shares the same quota pool.

<Note>
  Extractions and draws also consume quota proportional to the number of results processed. Use the [estimate endpoint](/api-reference/extractions/estimate) or the `estimate-extraction` MCP tool to preview costs before running large jobs.
</Note>

<Info>
  **Free operations** — the following do not consume any quota: monitors, webhooks, account status, [trends](/guides/trends), extraction history, draw history, cost estimates, tweet composition (compose, refine, score), style cache management, and drafts.
</Info>

## Checking Usage

Call `GET /api/v1/account` to see your current period usage:

```bash
curl -s https://xquik.com/api/v1/account \
 -H "x-api-key: xq_YOUR_KEY_HERE" | jq
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "plan": "active",
  "monitorsAllowed": 1,
  "monitorsUsed": 1,
  "currentPeriod": {
    "start": "2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2026-03-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "usagePercent": 45
  }
}
```

The `usagePercent` field shows how much of your monthly quota has been consumed (0-100). At 100%, metered calls are rejected.

<Tip>
  Poll the account endpoint periodically to track usage. Build alerts when `usagePercent` exceeds 80 to avoid hitting the cap unexpectedly.
