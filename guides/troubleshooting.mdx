Common issues, error codes, and solutions. If your problem isn't covered here, reach out on [X @xquikcom](https://x.com/xquikcom).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Why am I getting 401 Unauthenticated?'>
    The API key is missing, invalid, or revoked. Check the following:

    - **Header name:** Must be `x-api-key` (lowercase). `Authorization` or `X-Api-Key` won't work.
    - **Key format:** Must start with `xq_`. If it doesn't, you're using the wrong value.
    - **Key revoked:** Revoked keys return 401 immediately. Generate a new key from the dashboard.
    - **Session-only endpoint:** The API Keys endpoints (`/api/v1/api-keys/*`) require session authentication (browser login), not API key auth. You cannot manage API keys via API key.

    ```bash
    # Correct
    curl https://xquik.com/api/v1/account \
      -H "x-api-key: xq_a1b2c3d4e5f6..."

    # Wrong - missing header
    curl https://xquik.com/api/v1/account
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Why am I getting 403 Monitor Limit Reached?'>
    Your plan allows 1 monitor by default. Creating a second monitor returns:

    ```json
    { "error": "monitor_limit_reached", "limit": 1 }
    ```

    **Solutions:**
    - Delete an unused monitor to free a slot: `DELETE /api/v1/monitors/{id}`
    - Add more monitors from the dashboard billing page ($10/month each)
    - Check your current usage: `GET /api/v1/account` shows `monitorsAllowed` and `monitorsUsed`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Webhooks not arriving?'>
    Webhooks can fail silently. Walk through this checklist:

    1. **Webhook is active:** Verify `isActive: true` via `GET /api/v1/webhooks`. Inactive webhooks don't receive deliveries.
    2. **HTTPS required:** HTTP endpoints are rejected. Your URL must start with `https://`.
    3. **Response time:** Your endpoint must respond with `2xx` within 10 seconds. Timeouts count as failures.
    4. **Check deliveries:** Call `GET /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/deliveries` to see delivery status, attempt count, and error messages.
    5. **Local testing:** If using ngrok or a tunnel, verify it's running and the URL is current. Ngrok URLs change on restart (free plan).
    6. **Event type mismatch:** Your webhook must subscribe to the event types your monitors produce. A webhook listening for `tweet.new` won't receive `tweet.reply` events.

    <Tip>
      See the [Webhook Testing](/guides/webhook-testing) guide for a step-by-step local setup with ngrok.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Monitor not tracking events?'>
    If your monitor is active but no events appear:

    - **Check `isActive`:** Confirm via `GET /api/v1/monitors/{id}` that `isActive` is `true`. Paused monitors don't track.
    - **Event propagation delay:** Events take seconds to minutes to appear depending on X API latency. This is normal.
    - **Event types:** Verify your monitor's `eventTypes` array includes the type you expect. A monitor tracking only `["tweet.new"]` won't capture replies or retweets.
    - **Account activity:** The monitored X account must actually post content matching your event types. No posts = no events.
    - **Pagination:** If listing events, check `hasMore` in the response. Older events may be on subsequent pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Getting 429 Too Many Requests?'>
    You've exceeded the API rate limit:

    | Scope | Limit | Burst |
    |-------|-------|-------|
    | API endpoints (`/api/v1/*`) | 10 req/s | 20 |

    **Solutions:**
    - Implement exponential backoff. Start at 1 second, double on each retry, max 5 retries.
    - Check the `Retry-After` header for the server-recommended wait time.
    - Use webhooks instead of polling. Webhooks push events to you in real time, eliminating the need for repeated API calls.
    - Batch your logic. Fetch events once per minute instead of once per second.

    See the [Rate Limits](/guides/rate-limits) guide for backoff code examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='How do I check my usage?'>
    Call `GET /api/v1/account`. The `currentPeriod` object shows your usage:

    ```json
    {
      "currentPeriod": {
        "start": "2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z",
        "end": "2026-03-01T00:00:00.000Z",
        "capMicrocents": "10000000",
        "usedMicrocents": "1500000"
      }
    }
    ```

    - `capMicrocents`: Your monthly usage cap (internal unit)
    - `usedMicrocents`: How much you've consumed this period (internal unit)
    - **Remaining:** `capMicrocents - usedMicrocents`

    The dashboard also displays usage graphically on the billing page.

    See [Billing & Usage](/guides/billing) for monthly operation limits and usage scenarios.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Can I use the API without a subscription?'>
    Partially. Non-metered endpoints work without an active subscription:

    - **Work without subscription:** Monitors, events, webhooks, API keys, account management
    - **Require subscription:** Draws, extractions, X API lookups (tweets, users, follower checks) return `402` with `no_subscription`

    Subscribe from the [dashboard](https://xquik.com) billing page to unlock metered endpoints. Access activates immediately after payment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='How do I connect an AI agent?'>
    Xquik provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI agent integration. 9 tools are available on port 3100.

    **Setup:**
    1. Get your API key from the dashboard
    2. Configure your AI client with the MCP server URL and API key
    3. The agent authenticates via the `x-api-key` header, same as the REST API

    **Supported clients:**
    - Claude Desktop
    - Claude Code
    - Any MCP-compatible AI agent

    See the [MCP Server overview](/mcp/overview) for full setup instructions and the [MCP Tools](/mcp/tools) reference for all 9 available tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Getting 402 errors?'>
    No active subscription or monthly usage quota exhausted. Possible error codes: `no_subscription`, `subscription_inactive`, `usage_limit_reached`. This affects metered endpoints (draws, extractions, tweet lookups, user lookups, follower checks).

    **Solutions:**
    - Check your remaining balance via `GET /api/v1/account` (`usedMicrocents` vs `capMicrocents`)
    - Wait for the next billing period (quota resets automatically)
    - Use [Estimate Extraction](/api-reference/extractions/estimate) before running extractions to avoid surprises

    Management endpoints (monitors, events, webhooks, API keys, account) are not affected and continue to work normally.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Extraction failing with 502?'>
    The upstream X API is temporarily unavailable. This is usually transient.

    **Solutions:**
    - Retry the request after 5-10 seconds
    - Use exponential backoff (see [Error Handling](/guides/error-handling))
    - If the error persists for more than 5 minutes, the X API may be experiencing an outage

    The same applies to draws and X API lookup endpoints (`/api/v1/x/*`).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='How do I export extraction results?'>
    Call `GET /api/v1/extractions/{id}/export?format=csv` (or `xlsx` or `md`). The response is a file download.

    **Limits:**
    - Maximum 50,000 rows per export
    - Available formats: CSV, XLSX, Markdown

    See [Export Extraction](/api-reference/extractions/export) for column details and code examples.
