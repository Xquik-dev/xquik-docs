# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve the Xquik docs. This file covers how to set up your environment, the conventions we follow, and how to get a change merged.

## Quick start

1. Fork the repository or create a branch if you have write access.
2. Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint): `npm install -g mint`.
3. Run a local preview: `mint dev` (serves at `http://localhost:3000`).
4. Make your edits to the relevant `.mdx`, `.md`, `openapi.yaml`, or `docs.json`.
5. Run `mint broken-links`, `mint validate`, `mint a11y`, and (when touching the API spec) `mint openapi-check openapi.yaml`.
6. Commit, push, and open a pull request against `main`.

## What kinds of contributions are welcome

- Typo and clarity fixes on any page.
- New or improved code samples (curl, Python, TypeScript, etc.) on endpoint pages.
- New guides for common integration patterns. Open an issue first so we can agree on scope.
- New factual comparison and migration guides that help users evaluate X workflow options.
- OpenAPI spec corrections when documented behaviour does not match the live API. Verify against the live API before submitting.
- SDK landing-page updates when an SDK adds a feature or changes auth semantics.

## What we do not accept here

- Changes to internal product behaviour. The Xquik app is closed-source and lives in a separate repository; documentation must follow real behaviour, not propose new behaviour.
- Promotional or search-only content. Keep comparison pages factual, technical, and useful.
- Auto-generated SDK code. Each SDK has its own repository under the [Xquik-dev](https://github.com/Xquik-dev) org.

## Style rules

These are non-negotiable for merged PRs.

### Wording

- Active voice, imperative mood, no hedging. Under 15 words per sentence where possible.
- Numerals over words ("3 retries", not "three retries"). Use `&` over "and" only inside titles or short labels; prose uses "and".
- Title Case for page titles (Chicago style). Sentence case for section headings inside a page.
- Errors should describe the problem and the fix in one breath: "Subscription required. Subscribe to call this endpoint."

### Punctuation

- **No em dash (`-`, U+2014) and no `--` (space hyphen hyphen space) anywhere** - in `.mdx`, `.md`, code samples, JSON, or commit messages. Use `-` (space hyphen space) instead. When editing a file that already contains an em dash, fix it as part of the edit.
- Use a real ellipsis character (`…`) for loading or "more" indicators rather than `...`.
- Avoid emojis unless the page already uses them consistently.

### Code samples

- Show the smallest example that demonstrates the feature.
- Default to `curl` for HTTP examples on REST endpoint pages, and at least one SDK example (Python or TypeScript) for any non-trivial flow.
- Always include realistic placeholder values, never real account IDs or live API keys.
- Show the response payload, not just the request.

### MDX components

- Prefer Mintlify built-ins (`<CodeGroup>`, `<Tabs>`, `<Steps>`, `<Tip>`, `<Warning>`) over custom HTML.
- Keep front-matter minimal: `title`, `description`, and where relevant `api` and `openapi`.

## OpenAPI changes

`openapi.yaml` is the source of truth that drives the rendered REST reference and the generated SDKs. Treat it carefully.

- Run `mintlify openapi-check openapi.yaml` locally before pushing.
- Do not introduce new endpoints here speculatively. Endpoints are added only after they ship in the live API.
- Breaking changes require coordination with the SDK release process; flag them in the PR description.

## Commit and PR conventions

- Use Conventional Commits prefixes: `docs:`, `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`. Most contributions here are `docs:` or `fix:`.
- Keep commit messages descriptive but tight. Reference any related GitHub issue using `Closes #123` or `Refs #123` in the PR body.
- One logical change per PR. Combining a typo fix with a new guide makes review harder.
- The PR description should answer: what changed, why it matters, how it was verified.

## Reviews and merging

- Maintainers review on a best-effort basis. Expect a first response within 3 business days.
- Once approved, a maintainer merges and Mintlify auto-deploys to [docs.xquik.com](https://docs.xquik.com) within minutes.

## Code of conduct

Be civil. Personal attacks, harassment, and discriminatory language are not tolerated and will result in immediate removal. Disagreements about technical content should stay technical.
