## Local development

Install Bun, Go, Gitleaks, shfmt & uv. Use the pinned npm version in `package.json`.

```bash
bunx --bun npm@12.0.1 ci --ignore-scripts
bun run check:all
```

Clone the application beside this repository for product contract checks.
Otherwise, set `XQUIK_ROOT` & `XQUIK_PRODUCT_ROOT` to the application candidate.
Missing product source fails validation.
Reuse verified static checks through the application's existing validation cache.
Changes to docs, dependencies, or commands invalidate those results.
Full tests, coverage, LOC checks, and measurement reports always run.

Coverage compares the full suite against the parent commit.
Retain its verified reports under Git's `coverage-baselines/<parent SHA>/` directory.
Missing parent evidence fails validation.

Run `bun run --bun --no-install mint dev` when visual previewing is necessary.

## Deployment

`main` auto-deploys to [docs.xquik.com](https://docs.xquik.com).
Deployment status appears in commit check runs.

GitHub Actions is unavailable. Run every required check locally before pushing.
Verify the published pages after deployment.
