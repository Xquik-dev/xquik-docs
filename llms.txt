# Xquik

> X (Twitter) real-time data platform — xquik.com

Xquik provides real-time monitoring of X (Twitter) accounts, extraction tools for pulling followers/following/engagement data, transparent giveaway draws, and a developer API for programmatic integration. The platform tracks tweets, quotes, replies, and retweets from monitored accounts and delivers events via REST API polling, HMAC-signed webhooks, or an MCP server for AI agent integration.

Developers authenticate with API keys (format: `xqk_` + 32 hex characters) passed via the `x-api-key` header. All endpoints are served over HTTPS at `https://xquik.com/api/v1`. The platform requires an active subscription ($20/month) which includes 1 account monitor and a $10/month API usage cap. Additional monitors cost $10/month each.

## API Endpoints

- GET /api/v1/account — Retrieve account info, subscription status, and usage
- POST /api/v1/api-keys — Create a new API key (session auth only)
- GET /api/v1/api-keys — List all API keys (session auth only)
- DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/{id} — Revoke an API key (session auth only)
- POST /api/v1/monitors — Create a monitor for an X account
- GET /api/v1/monitors — List all monitors
- GET /api/v1/monitors/{id} — Get a monitor by ID
- PATCH /api/v1/monitors/{id} — Update monitor event types or active state
- DELETE /api/v1/monitors/{id} — Delete a monitor
- GET /api/v1/events — List events with filtering and cursor-based pagination
- GET /api/v1/events/{id} — Get a single event by ID
- POST /api/v1/webhooks — Create a webhook endpoint
- GET /api/v1/webhooks — List all webhooks
- PATCH /api/v1/webhooks/{id} — Update a webhook
- DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/{id} — Delete a webhook
- GET /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/deliveries — List delivery attempts for a webhook

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication via the `x-api-key` header containing a valid API key. API key management endpoints (create, list, revoke) require session cookie authentication instead. Monitor and webhook endpoints support dual authentication (API key or session cookie).

## Event Types

- tweet.new — New tweet posted by monitored account
- tweet.quote — Quote tweet posted by monitored account
- tweet.reply — Reply posted by monitored account
- tweet.retweet — Retweet posted by monitored account

## Rate Limits

- API endpoints: 10 requests/second sustained, 20 burst
- General requests: 20 requests/second sustained, 40 burst
- Exceeding limits returns 429 with Retry-After header

## Usage Costs (microcents per operation)

- Tweet search: 150 ($0.00015)
- User lookup: 180 ($0.00018)
- Follower fetch: 150 ($0.00015)
- Verified follower fetch: 300 ($0.00030)
- Follow check: 150 ($0.00015)
- Monthly cap: $10 (10,000,000,000 microcents)

## MCP Server

The MCP server runs at `https://xquik.com:3100/mcp` using StreamableHTTP transport. Authenticate with the same API keys via the `x-api-key` header.

### MCP Tools

- list-monitors — List all monitored X accounts
- add-monitor — Start monitoring an X account (params: username, eventTypes)
- remove-monitor — Stop monitoring an account (params: monitorId)
- get-events — Query events with filters (params: limit?, monitorId?, eventType?, afterCursor?)
- get-event — Get event by ID (params: eventId)
- search-tweets — Search tweets (params: query) — costs 150 microcents/tweet
- get-user-info — Get X user profile (params: username) — costs 180 microcents
- list-webhooks — List all webhook endpoints
- add-webhook — Register webhook endpoint (params: url, eventTypes)

## Webhooks

Webhook deliveries are HTTPS POST requests signed with HMAC-SHA256. The signature is sent in the `X-Signature` header as `sha256=` + hex digest. Verify by computing HMAC-SHA256(webhook_secret, raw_body) and comparing with constant-time comparison. Failed deliveries retry 3 times with exponential backoff.

## Error Codes

- 400 invalid_input — Request body validation failed
- 400 invalid_id — Path parameter is not a valid ID
- 401 unauthenticated — Missing or invalid API key
- 403 monitor_limit_reached — Plan monitor limit exceeded
- 404 not_found — Resource does not exist
- 409 monitor_already_exists — Duplicate monitor for same X account
- 429 — Rate limited (retry with backoff)
- 500 internal_error — Server error

## Common Use Cases

1. Monitor & Poll: Create a monitor for an X account, then poll GET /api/v1/events periodically to retrieve new activity
2. Real-Time Webhooks: Create a monitor and webhook, receive instant HTTPS POST notifications when events occur
3. AI Agent: Configure the MCP server in Claude Desktop/Code to let AI agents search tweets, monitor accounts, and retrieve events conversationally
4. Data Extraction: Use the dashboard extraction tools to pull followers, following, retweeters, likers, quoters, replies, list members, and verified followers
5. Giveaway Draws: Run transparent random draws with archived tweet snapshots and public result pages
