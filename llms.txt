# Xquik

> X (Twitter) real-time data platform. Real-time account monitoring, data extraction, giveaway draws, and a developer API with REST endpoints, HMAC webhooks, and an MCP server for AI agents.

Xquik tracks tweets, quotes, replies, retweets, and follower changes from monitored X accounts and delivers events via REST API polling, HMAC-signed webhooks, or an MCP server (Model Context Protocol) for AI agent integration. The platform provides 19 extraction tools for pulling replies, reposts, quotes, followers, following, verified followers, community members, community moderators, community posts, community search, list members, list posts, list followers, mentions, posts, threads, articles, Space participants, and people search results from any public account, tweet, list, community, or Space. It also offers giveaway draws with configurable filters and X data lookups (tweets, users, follower checks).

Authentication: API key passed via the `x-api-key` header, or OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code with PKCE (for browser-based MCP clients like Claude.ai and ChatGPT Developer Mode). Key format: `xq_` + 64 hex characters. Base URL: `https://xquik.com/api/v1`. MCP server: `https://xquik.com/mcp` (StreamableHTTP transport, API key or OAuth Bearer token). Event types: `tweet.new`, `tweet.quote`, `tweet.reply`, `tweet.retweet`, `follower.gained`, `follower.lost`. Rate limits: 10 req/s sustained with 20 burst for API endpoints.
