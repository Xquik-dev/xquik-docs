# Xquik

> X (Twitter) real-time data platform. Real-time account monitoring, data extraction, giveaway draws, and a developer API with REST endpoints, HMAC webhooks, and an MCP server for AI agents.

Xquik tracks tweets, quotes, replies, and retweets from monitored X accounts and delivers events via REST API polling, HMAC-signed webhooks, or an MCP server (Model Context Protocol) for AI agent integration. The platform provides 8 extraction tools for pulling replies, retweets, quotes, followers, verified followers, community members, mentions, and user search results from any public account or tweet. It also offers giveaway draws with configurable filters and X data lookups (tweets, users, follower checks).

Authentication: API key passed via the `x-api-key` header. Key format: `xq_` + 64 hex characters. Base URL: `https://xquik.com/api/v1`. MCP server: `https://xquik.com:3100/mcp` (StreamableHTTP transport, same API key auth). Event types: `tweet.new`, `tweet.quote`, `tweet.reply`, `tweet.retweet`. Rate limits: 10 req/s sustained with 20 burst for API endpoints.
