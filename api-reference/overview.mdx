# API Overview

The Xquik REST API v1 provides programmatic access to monitors, events, webhooks, and account management.

## Base URL

```
https://xquik.com/api/v1
```

All endpoints are served over HTTPS. HTTP requests are redirected.

## Authentication

API requests require an API key passed via the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
x-api-key: xqk_YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

Some endpoints also accept session cookie authentication (from the dashboard). See the [authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) for details.

## Rate Limits

| Scope | Limit | Burst |
|-------|-------|-------|
| API endpoints | 10 req/s | 20 |
| General requests | 20 req/s | 40 |

Rate limits are enforced at the server level. Exceeding limits returns `429 Too Many Requests`.

## Conventions

### IDs

All IDs are returned as strings representing bigint values:

```json
{ "id": "123456789" }
```

### Timestamps

All timestamps are ISO 8601 in UTC:

```json
{ "createdAt": "2026-02-24T10:30:00.000Z" }
```

### Error Responses

All errors follow a consistent format:

```json
{ "error": "error_code" }
```

| Status | Error Code | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| 400 | `invalid_input` | Request body failed validation |
| 400 | `invalid_id` | Path parameter is not a valid ID |
| 401 | `unauthenticated` | Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | `monitor_limit_reached` | Plan monitor limit exceeded |
| 404 | `not_found` | Resource does not exist or is not owned by you |
| 409 | `monitor_already_exists` | Duplicate monitor for the same X account |
| 429 | - | Rate limited |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Server error |

### Pagination

List endpoints return up to 200 items. The events endpoint supports cursor-based pagination:

```json
{
  "events": [...],
  "hasMore": true,
  "nextCursor": "MjAyNi0wMi0yNFQxMDozMDowMC4wMDBafDEyMzQ1Njc4OQ=="
}
```

Pass `nextCursor` as the `after` query parameter to fetch the next page.

## Event Types

These event types are used across monitors, webhooks, and events:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tweet.new` | New tweet posted |
| `tweet.quote` | Quote tweet posted |
| `tweet.reply` | Reply posted |
| `tweet.retweet` | Retweet posted |
