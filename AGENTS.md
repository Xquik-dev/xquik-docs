# Xquik docs

This repository is the public documentation site. Treat every committed file as
public-facing unless it is explicitly a standard open-source project file.

## Delivery gates

- Preserve the parent commit's TS/JS statement, branch, function & line coverage across the full source, including untested code. No per-commit increase or LOC reduction is required, & coverage below 100% alone never blocks delivery. Weakened tests or new exclusions never count as gains; track other-language gaps separately.
- Run every applicable local check through `bun run check:all`: tests, coverage, LOC, types, lint, formatting, security, contracts & docs. Report p99 measurement coverage honestly, including gaps. Failed, incomplete or unavailable checks block delivery.
- `bun run check:all` targets 30 seconds & a deployment 60 seconds including setup & verification. A timing overrun is a performance error to record & fix; it never blocks an otherwise passing change by itself. Build timing, p99 coverage, performance, costs & discovery scores are improvement targets.
- Fix security, correctness, billing, deployment-safety & contract defects before shipping. Publish required docs before the affected application deployment & verify production before calling a deployment complete.
- Work autonomously through that outcome: proceed on reversible steps the request implies, stop only for destructive actions or genuine scope changes, & finish the whole request rather than announcing the next step. Keep changes to what the task asks for; report unrelated findings in the PR.

## Confidentiality

- Do not commit private handoffs, research, prompts, audit logs, or scratch files.
- Keep `DOCS_QUALITY_POLL.md` local only. It is ignored by Git and must never
  be force-added.
- Do not publish private implementation, infrastructure, routing, cost, or
  deployment details.
- Use generic terms such as "own infrastructure", "read service", "write
  service", "browser service", or "network egress service".
- Remove confidential details from the staged diff before committing.

## Docs workflow

- Pull latest changes and inspect `git status` before edits.
- Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Keep docs `openapi.yaml` aligned with `/Users/burak/Developer/xquik/openapi.yaml`
  unless a documented reason requires them to differ.
- Run static docs checks only unless the user explicitly asks for local servers
  or browser checks.
- Prefer `bun run test:agent-docs`, `bunx --bun mint validate`, and
  `bunx --bun mint broken-links`.
- If adding a root Markdown support file, either keep it ignored or make it an
  intentional public docs page with frontmatter and navigation.

## Archive dependency repair

- Use `bun run install:frozen` for reproducible installations without dependency lifecycle scripts.
- The npm override replaces the archive extractor with `@xhmikosr/decompress`.
- `patches/mintlify-archives.patch` migrates its callers and uses `zip-a-folder` for exports.
- Preserve upstream licensing and run `check:patches` through `check:all`.
- Remove the patch only after upstream callers use verified safe archive implementations.
