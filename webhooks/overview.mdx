Webhooks deliver events from monitored X accounts to your server in real time. Every delivery is signed with HMAC-SHA256 so you can verify authenticity.

## How It Works

```text
X Account Activity → Xquik Stream → Your Webhook Endpoint
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a monitor">
    Monitor an X account for specific event types (tweets, replies, quotes, retweets, follower changes).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register a webhook">
    Provide an HTTPS URL and select which event types to receive. Xquik generates a signing secret.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive events">
    When a monitored account triggers an event, Xquik sends an HTTPS POST to your endpoint with the event payload and an HMAC signature header.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify & process">
    Verify the `X-Xquik-Signature` header using your webhook secret, then process the event.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Delivery Format

Webhook events are delivered as HTTPS POST requests.

### Headers

| Header | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Payload is always JSON |
| `X-Xquik-Signature` | `sha256=HMAC_HEX_DIGEST` | HMAC-SHA256 signature for verification |

### Payload Body

```json
{
  "eventType": "tweet.new",
  "username": "elonmusk",
  "data": {
    "tweetId": "1893456789012345678",

      "likes": 42000,
      "retweets": 8500,
      "replies": 3200
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `eventType` | string | Event type (see below) |
| `username` | string | X username of the monitored account |
| `data` | object | Event-specific payload (varies by type) |

## Event Data Shapes

```

### follower.gained

A new follower gained by the monitored account.

```json
{

  "data": {
    "followerId": "44196398",
    "followerUsername": "newFollower",
    "followerName": "New Follower",
    "followerFollowersCount": 500,
    "followerVerified": false
  }
}
```

### follower.lost

A follower lost by the monitored account.

```json

    "followerName": "Lost Follower",
    "followerFollowersCount": 500,
    "followerVerified": false
  }
}
```

## Retry Policy

Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff (base 1s, multiplier 2x):

| Attempt | Delay |
|---------|-------|
| 1 | 1 second |
| 2 | 2 seconds |
| 3 | 4 seconds |
| 4 | 8 seconds |
| 5 | 16 seconds |

After 5 failed attempts, the delivery is marked as `exhausted`. Check delivery status via the [deliveries endpoint](/api-reference/webhooks/deliveries).

## Requirements

- Endpoint **must** use HTTPS
- Endpoint **must** respond with `2xx` within 10 seconds
- Non-2xx responses or timeouts count as failures
