# Webhooks

Webhooks deliver events from monitored X accounts to your server in real time. Every delivery is signed with HMAC-SHA256 so you can verify authenticity.

## How It Works

```
X Account Activity → Xquik Stream → Your Webhook Endpoint
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a monitor">
    Monitor an X account for specific event types (tweets, replies, quotes, retweets).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register a webhook">
    Provide an HTTPS URL and select which event types to receive. Xquik generates a signing secret.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive events">
    When a monitored account triggers an event, Xquik sends an HTTPS POST to your endpoint with the event payload and an HMAC signature header.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify & process">
    Verify the `X-Signature` header using your webhook secret, then process the event.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Delivery Format

Webhook events are delivered as HTTPS POST requests.

### Headers

| Header | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Payload is always JSON |
| `X-Signature` | `sha256=HMAC_HEX_DIGEST` | HMAC-SHA256 signature for verification |
| `X-Delivery-Id` | `9001` | Unique delivery ID — use for idempotency |

### Payload Body

```json
{
  "id": "9001",
  "type": "tweet.new",

### tweet.retweet

A retweet posted by the monitored account. Includes `retweetedTweetId` and `retweetedUsername` referencing the original tweet.

```json
{
  "id": "9004",
  "type": "tweet.retweet",

  "username": "elonmusk",
  "occurredAt": "2026-02-24T17:30:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "tweetId": "1893456789012345681",

## Retry Policy

Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff:

| Attempt | Delay |
|---------|-------|
| 1 | Immediate |
| 2 | ~30 seconds |
| 3 | ~2 minutes |

After 3 failed attempts, the delivery is marked as `failed`. Check delivery status via the [deliveries endpoint](/api-reference/webhooks/deliveries).

## Requirements

- Endpoint **must** use HTTPS
- Endpoint **must** respond with `2xx` within 10 seconds
- Non-2xx responses or timeouts count as failures
